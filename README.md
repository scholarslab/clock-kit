# Clock Kit
 
## Project Description: 

This project creates a data visualization clock by using a Raspberry Pi and LEDs. When connected to the Internet, the Raspberry Pi can be programmed to capture real time or static data which can then be displayed on the clock face. The traditional clock face is represented with an RGB LED at each of the twelve numbers.
 
## Purpose: 

To provide the user with opportunity to learn manufacturing, electronics, programming, and research using big data.
